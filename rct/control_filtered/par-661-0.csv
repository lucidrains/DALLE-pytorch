you mean right now tell you
the boy is stealing the jar
and on a stool thats falling down
and the girl is laughing at him
and the mother is washing but preoccupied
and the water is flowing over the sink
and theres trouble galore
the wind is blowing the
um she is not paying any attention to her
and um the boy in addition to stealing trying to give the
and the whole thing is going to collapse
but aside from that they seem to be a fairly happy family
