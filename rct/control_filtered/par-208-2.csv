the stool is tipping over
the boy is taking the jar
the cupboard is open
the girl is saying her finger to her mouth and also
the mother is washing
water is over from the sink onto the floor
and the the window is open
theres two and a saucer on the sink
and the she is stepping on the water on the floor
and she is drying the
and she is looking outside at the wow at the shrubbery
