well the girl is reaching for a that the boy is trying
am I going too fast
and the mother is washing
drying a plate gram
while the sink is over with water that is overflown from
and water is gushing out
and the girl is to be quiet not to let her
and I did say that drying the dish with the towel
and the splashing on the floor
