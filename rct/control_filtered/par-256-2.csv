the the making fun of the boy
she made fun of him so much while he was stealing a out
and it made him trip
and going to fall
the listening to the
drying
she got the window open against a mirror
paying attention to the sink
the water onto the floor
its getting her wet
the are open to allow fresh air to come in the house
theres two on the st a dish on the sink
and the are open and the cupboard door is open
like it might be spring or summer out because
she on
she on
he on
she on
she a dress
the lid is off the jar
theres s a fancy sink cabinet over here and a fancy wall
thats about it
