oh little in the jar gram
the standing down and waiting for him to give him
the doing the
and also him
oh the water just fell off over on the floor
can I turn the page
thats all there is except just getting all wet

the little girl was helping the boy to get to the jar
but he stumbling
he must have fell over because he to be falling there
and the over at the sink drying
and its going on the floor
and three three bowls there gram
