little stealing out of the jar gram
little whispering not to tell gram
his fall
his at the sink washing
the water all over
its running all over the floor
drying a plate
looking out the window
the little fall
got a in his hand
reaching for a second one
the mother looking outside and not watching the water
the cupboard door is open
she shouldnt be looking out the window
washing
the water run out
I dont know what else I could tell
